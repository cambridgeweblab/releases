A repository for Maven releases by Cambridge Web Lab

Note that you need to [authenticate to install packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#installing-a-package) despite this being a public repository.

To access these projects using Jitpack.io you can use the same groupId and artifactId, but you may need to add a 'v' before the version if we've not created a tag to match the Github release.
